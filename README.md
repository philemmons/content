Major kudos goes out to [Mark Otto](<https://twitter.com/mdo>), the developer of the [Lanyon]( http://lanyon.getpoole.com) theme that is derived from [Poole](http://getpoole.com), and the volunteers that maintain [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for the initial github.io website.

Also, listed below are great tutorials that were essential in getting this website online and customized.

Next, these three guides offer more functionality to my website as they improve the design and implementation for the user.
