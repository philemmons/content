> *"Embracing my inner nerd since 1969!"*

### Source Code

Major kudos goes out to [Mark Otto](<https://twitter.com/mdo>), the developer of the [Lanyon]( http://lanyon.getpoole.com) theme that is derived from [Poole](http://getpoole.com), and the volunteers that maintain [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for the initial github.io website.

Also, these great tutorials were essential in getting the website online and customized.

Lastly, I would like to thank Github for providing a hosting service that is CI/CD.
