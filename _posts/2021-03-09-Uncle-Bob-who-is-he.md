title: Uncle Bob - Who is he?

During a walk yesterday, I decided to jump on YouTube and take a look at what YouTube’s algorithm recommended for me. To my surprise it had a video about Clean Code by Uncle Bob and a little bit of rock and roll playing in the background with a couple of guys jumping about. This peek my interest, and I questioned, “What does clean code have to do with it an introduction like this?” After clicking on the YouTube video, I read the introduction without realizing who Robert Cecil Martin is, and continued reading the more info section for some insight about his lesson. The section that caught my eye was the Volkswagen ethic case which was discussed in a Software Engineering Meta class at CSUMB. After the ethic discussion about Volkswagen was, “why are programmers so slow?” Heck, I could relate to this and assumed this video would be about writing code faster. Boy, was I wrong! Hence, this was the starting point and worthy of series of write ups because other programmers should listen, and learn more about his coding advice and opinions.</p>

After an hour of listening, I decided to find out who this guy, Uncle Bob, was because he was making perfect sense. He discussed how programmers were unorganized, initially wanting to produce code as quickly as possible without thinking how to maintain it afterwards, or the people who read it.  His points were valid about the cryptic attitudes, and the reason programmers write code, so that others can maintain it, read it and understand it. </p>

“According to Wikipedia, Uncle Bob is Robert Cecil Martin. He's an American software engineer instructor and bestselling author he is the most recognized for developing many software design principles for being a founder of the influential agile manifesto Martin has authored many books and magazines.” https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin<p>
