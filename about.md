### *Life is Beautiful*

As an IT professional, I have a strong interest in creating safe, smart, and efficient technological solutions. Whether I'm managing IT infrastructure or developing software, I like taking on difficult tasks and finding solutions. Being skilled in a number of programming languages and frameworks, I'm always looking into new technologies that promote creativity and streamline procedures. With a strong foundation in computer science and a commitment to lifelong learning, I'm determined to advance, transform, and make a big impact in the tech sector.
### Bring Ideas to life!

Currently, I am committed to beginning my second career as Software Engineer, as it will be an adventure using the skills that has been developed over the years.
* B.S. in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering from [California State University Monterey Bay](https://csumb.edu/) in 2018. The program is described [here](https://philemmons.github.io/content/2019/09/23/BachSci/).
* Both are from [Monterey Peninsula College](https://www.mpc.edu/) in 2016.
  * A.A. in Computer Science and Information Systems. 
  * A.S.T. in Mathematics.

### About the Site

Major kudos goes out to [Mark Otto](<https://twitter.com/mdo>), the developer of the [Lanyon]( http://lanyon.getpoole.com) theme that is derived from [Poole](http://getpoole.com), and the volunteers that maintain [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for the initial github.io website.
