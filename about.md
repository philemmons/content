My name is Phillip Emmons, and I have resided in Marina, California for sixteen years. As a very young man, I was enthralled with video game arcades. When our family acquired an [Atari800](http://oldcomputers.net/atari800.html), a five and a quarter inch floppy drive, and eventually a direct connect modem with a 300 baud upload/download speed, we were all looking forward to the hours of entertainment. The computer itself possessed 16k of RAM on cartridges much like an 8-track tape that were inserted into the console. Eventually, I copied my first program of a game into that system, and it was a magical moment!

Currently, I am committed to beginning my second career as Software Engineer, developed over the years of education.
* B.S. in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering from [California State University Monterey Bay](https://csumb.edu/) in 2018. The program is described [here](https://philemmons.github.io/content/2019/09/23/BachSci/).
* Both are from [Monterey Peninsula College](https://www.mpc.edu/) in 2016.
  * A.A. in Computer Science and Information Systems. 
  * A.S.T. in Mathematics.

 *It will be exciting to see what the future has in store.*
