## About Me

<p> My name is Phillip Emmons, and I have resided in Marina California for sixteen years. As a very young man I was enthralled with video game arcades. When our family acquired an Atari 800,  a five and a quarter inch floppy drive, and eventually a direct connect modem with a 300 baud upload download speed, we were all looking forward to the hours of entertainment. The computer itself possessed 16k of RAM on cartridges much like an 8-track tape that were inserted into it. I copied my first program of a game into that system and that moment was magical.</p>  

<p>Currently, I am committed to beginning my second career  as a software engineer, developed over the years of education.  My degrees consist of an A.A. in Computer Science and Information Systems, an A.S.T. in Mathematics that both are from Monterey Peninsula College with highest honors in 2016, and B.S. in Computer Science with a Software Engineering concentration from California State University Monterey Bay in 2018 with honors also. </p>

<p>It will be exciting to see what the future has in store. :+1: </p>
