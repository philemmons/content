 ### *Life is Beautiful*
 <br/><br/>
My name is Phillip Emmons, and I have resided in Marina, California for sixteen years. As a very young man, I was enthralled with video game arcades. When our family acquired an [Atari800](http://oldcomputers.net/atari800.html), a five and a quarter inch floppy drive, and eventually a direct connect modem with a 300 baud upload/download speed, we were all looking forward to the hours of entertainment. The computer itself possessed 16k of RAM on cartridges much like an 8-track tape that were inserted into the console. Eventually, I copied my first program of a game into that system, and it was a magical moment!

Currently, I am committed to beginning my second career as Software Engineer, as it will be an adventure using the skills that has been developed over the years.
* B.S. in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering from [California State University Monterey Bay](https://csumb.edu/) in 2018. The program is described [here](https://philemmons.github.io/content/2019/09/23/BachSci/).
* Both are from [Monterey Peninsula College](https://www.mpc.edu/) in 2016.
  * A.A. in Computer Science and Information Systems. 
  * A.S.T. in Mathematics.

### About the Site

Major kudos goes out to [Mark Otto](<https://twitter.com/mdo>), the developer of the [Lanyon]( http://lanyon.getpoole.com) theme that is derived from [Poole](http://getpoole.com), and the volunteers that maintain [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for the initial github.io website.

Also, these are some great tutorials that were essential in getting this website online and customized.

Next, these three guides offer more functionality to my website as to improve the design and implementation for the user.

Finally, I would like to thank Github for providing a hosting service that is CI/CD.
